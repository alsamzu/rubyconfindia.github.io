        <p><strong>Talk: This Bot Will Pump You Up!</strong></p>
        <p class="about-speaker">Bots got me in amazing shape. My goal was to be able to do a handstand but I took it much further than that. I built a series of fitness related bots as a side project and I learned a ton about what works with bot development and conversational interfaces. Did you know messaging apps are growing faster than social networks? In this talk I'll show you the ins and outs of using Ruby to create bots for this enormous audience. Get ripped with Ruby!</p>

<p><strong>10 things (not) to do before going to production with rails+mongo+sidekiq</strong></p>
<p>We all know it doesn’t take much to code up a simple application in Rails with mongo. But what happens when your app is a hit with your users? Simple things which were working just fine start behaving weirdly and the next thing you know your app is sluggish, crashing every few hours when the load spikes. This talk is a summary of all the things that i have encountered while taking our product from 0 to 5000+ users handling more than a million transactions on a daily basis. It covers simple rails patterns that scale, ones that fail, design patterns and system architecture that will help have a peaceful sleep at nights, designing your datastore for scale, better background processing, monitoring. Attendees can learn about all the ways their can fail so that they plan ahead for them.</p>
