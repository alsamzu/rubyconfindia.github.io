          <p><strong>Talk: Reflection in Ruby: Understanding the Implications of Loading Gems and Files</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">
            Have you wondered what is provided by a gem? What about monkey patches?
            Can you be sure that new changes do not conflict with old ones?
            We will demonstrate how to use Ruby’s built-in reflection methods
            to address all of these topics, building up from foundations available to every Ruby developer.

          <p><strong>Talk: A Rack and Morty adventure in serving requests</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">
            In this talk you’ll go through Rack from request to response.
            Starting with a basic “Hello C137” request and moving to something more complex.
            We’ll find what Rack enables us to do, write tests for our code,
            learn how to create reusable middleware, and how it fits in Ruby frameworks like Rails.
