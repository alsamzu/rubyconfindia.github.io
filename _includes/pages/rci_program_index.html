          <p><strong>Talk: This Bot Will Pump You Up!</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">Bots got me in amazing shape. My goal was to be able to do a handstand but I took it much further than that. I built a series of fitness related bots as a side project and I learned a ton about what works with bot development and conversational interfaces. Did you know messaging apps are growing faster than social networks? In this talk I'll show you the ins and outs of using Ruby to create bots for this enormous audience. Get ripped with Ruby!</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: 10 things (not) to do before going to production with rails+mongo+sidekiq</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">We all know it doesn’t take much to code up a simple application in Rails with mongo. But what happens when your app is a hit with your users? Simple things which were working just fine start behaving weirdly and the next thing you know your app is sluggish, crashing every few hours when the load spikes. This talk is a summary of all the things that i have encountered while taking our product from 0 to 5000+ users handling more than a million transactions on a daily basis. It covers simple rails patterns that scale, ones that fail, design patterns and system architecture that will help have a peaceful sleep at nights, designing your datastore for scale, better background processing, monitoring. Attendees can learn about all the ways their can fail so that they plan ahead for them.</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Scientific Computing on JRuby</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">JRuby is known for performance. NMatrix, a linear algebra library, now supports JRuby. All SciRuby gems that depend on NMatrix can now be run on JRuby. A scientific library must be highly efficient as the programs can be memory intensive. The programs must be fast at the same time. This calls for optimization. Suppose, you are running a Ruby program and you need to make it faster; you use threads, yet you are not happy with the results! Just chain the Ruby methods to Java methods. Using Java method can improve the speed, around 1000 times when compared to using Ruby method. Not only speed, it can help you save a lot of RAM, around 10 times. JRuby’s Garbage Collection can sometimes slow down your program if you are not careful with handling a large amount of data.</p>

          <p class="about-speaker">No one wants to be stuck in the slow lane, especially Rubyists. In this talk we'll look at the slow process of writing fast code. We'll look at several real world performance optimizations that may surprise you. We'll then rewind to see how these slow spots were found and fixed. Come to this talk and we will "C" how fast your Ruby can "Go".</p>

          <p><strong>Talk: Introducing Rubex: A better way to write Ruby extensions</strong></p>
          <p class="about-speaker">Previously, Rubyists mainly depended on FFI, SWIG or Rice for easily writing C extensions. However, all abstractions leak, and this approach has many pitfalls when it comes to interfacing Ruby with complex C interfaces that require ‘glue’ code. The only option left, in that case, is to write a C extension manually. Writing C extensions is a very tedious process. You need to change your thinking paradigm when programming, there are very few reliable debugging tools available and the programmer needs to be well versed with the CRuby C API. Moreover, the CRuby C API can change with a new release of Ruby, and the library will most probably break when upgrading Ruby versions. And of course most of you don’t like C programming more than Ruby programming. In this talk you will be introduced to Rubex, a new Crystal-inspired language that makes writing Ruby C extensions super simple. Rubex looks very similar to Ruby, and compiles to C code that implicitly interfaces with the CRuby C API. It provides ample functionality for creating any C data structures and data types and making them work with external C libraries.</p>

          <p class="about-speaker">Lazy programming has been a fundamental feature of a lot of programming languages, especially functional programming languages like Haskell. Being inspired by these languages, Ruby offers us a few nifty ways of doing lazy programming. The ability to avoid needless calculations, perform operations on potentially infinite sequences and defining control flow as abstracts can exponentially reduce the running time of your programs.</p>
